# ML-SONAR-SIGNAL-CLASSIFICATION-USING-LOGESRIC-REGRESSION-
This project is a machine learning model that classifies sonar signals as either rock (R) or mine (M) using Logistic Regression. The dataset contains 60 features representing sonar wave reflections, and the model predicts whether the signal is from a rock or a naval mine.
