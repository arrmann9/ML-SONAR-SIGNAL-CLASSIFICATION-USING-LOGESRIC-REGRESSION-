# ML SONAR SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION USING LOGESRIC REGRESSION:
This project is a machine learning model that classifies sonar signals as either rock (R) or mine (M) using Logistic Regression. The dataset consists of sonar signal readings, where each instance has 60 numerical features representing the reflection of sound waves.

Project Overview
Dataset: Sonar data (CSV file with 60 features and labels)
Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets (90% - 10%)
Model: Logistic Regression (using sklearn)
Evaluation: Accuracy score calculated for both training and test sets
Prediction: Takes a new sonar reading as input and predicts whether it's a rock or mine
Technologies Used
Python
NumPy & Pandas
Scikit-learn
How to Run
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions.
Future Improvements
Implement other classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
Feature engineering to improve accuracy
This project was fully implemented by me as part of my machine learning practice. ðŸš€
